# Adventure Works Report using Power BI
## Abstract:
This report can help company tracks core business KPIs(sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forecast, and also identify high valued customers.

## Sales Summary(Page1):
- I created a slicer with “between” style to choose the Time Period so that users can get the sales summary for any specific time period. 

- I created a Treemaps and a Stacked Bar Chart to display orders by category and subcategory separately so that users can choose the specific category and subcategory that they want to focus on. And also I edit the interactions so that when users select a specific category, all the unrelated information will be filtered out.

- I created a Matrix Table to display the product name, total orders, and return rate. I also applied the conditional formatting to return rates so that users can easily tell the item with dark background is the item that has the high return rate. 

- I created a Map to display the total order by continent so that users can easily choose a continent that they are interested in.

- I created three KPI to display performance for current monthly revenue versus target revenue, monthly orders versus target orders, and monthly returns versus target returns so that users can easily track the KPI.

- I created a drillthrough so that when users hover over a product, they can switch to another page with more detailed information about this product such as profit, return volume, future profit forecast. I also made use of the What-if Parameter feature, it can help them to set a more reasonable price because users can see the adjusted profit when they change the product price. 

## Customer's Details(Page2):
- I created a Matrix Table to display the customer name, total orders, and total returns. And also I applied the conditional formatting to total revenue so that users can easily tell which customer contributed the most revenue.

- I created three Donut Charts to display the orders by gender, by income level, and by occupation and also a Treemap to display the orders by age so that users can tell which kind of customers contributed the most revenue.

- I created a Line and Clustered Column Chart to display the orders and revenue by month so that users can tell when the specific customer ordered products and how much revenue they contributed for those products.

- I created a bookmark for the first report page and inserted a right arrow so that users can easily return to the sales summary page.
